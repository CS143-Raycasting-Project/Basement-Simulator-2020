# Basement Simulator 2020


Escape the basement of Carl the Deranged while he's vacationing in Yellowstone National Park!

Carl made sure to create the most labyrinthine basement that he could, so make sure to listen to my instructions.

Use WASD to move your character through the basement, and use the left and right arrow keys to turn. Navigate your way through the basement and reach the dark doorway that will be your exit. Use shift to sprint, and use left control to slowdown in case you think you hear Carl. If you pick up an item, press I to view what you've collected.

Make sure to map out the maze in your head to help you navigate, too. You should be able to see a mental represntation of your memory of the maze in the top left of your vision if you do it correctly.
