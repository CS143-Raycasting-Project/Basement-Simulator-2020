Escape the basement of Carl the Deranged while he's vacationing in Yellowstone National Park!

Carl made sure to create the most labyrinthine basement that he could, so make sure to listen to my instructions.

Use WASD to move your character through the basement, and use the left and right arrow keys to turn.
Navigate your way through the basement and reach the dark doorway that will be your exit.
